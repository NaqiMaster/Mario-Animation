# Mario Animation (C#)

## Overview
This project is a simple Mario character animation implemented in C#. The focus of the project is on frame-based sprite animation, timing control, and clean separation between animation logic and rendering.

This was built as a learning project to better understand how animations are handled programmatically in game development.

## Features
- Frame-based sprite animation
- Timing control for smooth frame transitions
- Basic character movement and animation sequencing
- Clean and readable C# code structure

## Technologies Used
- **Language:** C#
- **Concepts:** Frame-based animation, timing loops, object-oriented programming

## How It Works
- The animation cycles through a sequence of sprite frames
- A timing mechanism controls how often frames update
- Rendering logic is kept separate from animation state logic

## Purpose
This project was created to:
- Practice sprite animation fundamentals
- Understand timing and frame updates in games
- Build familiarity with animation pipelines in C#

## Notes
- This project focuses on animation rather than full gameplay mechanics
- It is intentionally lightweight and educational in scope
